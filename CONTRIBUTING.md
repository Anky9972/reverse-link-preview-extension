### Suggesting Enhancements

We love new ideas! Before suggesting enhancements:

3. **Describe the use case** - Why is this needed?
4. **Propose implementation** - How might it work?

**Enhancement template:**
```
**Problem**: Users want to preview links without hovering

**Proposed Solution**: Add keyboard shortcut to trigger preview on focused link

**Benefits**: 
- Better accessibility
- Power user efficiency
- Reduced accidental hovers

**Implementation Ideas**:
- Use Alt+P as shortcut
- Highlight focused link
- Show preview anchored to link
```

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Stable, production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent production fixes

### Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```

3. **Develop and commit** regularly

4. **Keep branch updated**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Prefer **const** over let, never use var
- Use **meaningful variable names**: `previewData` not `data`
- Use **destructuring** where appropriate
- Use **optional chaining**: `user?.profile?.name`
- Add **PropTypes** or TypeScript types (future)

**Good:**
```javascript
const ArticlePreview = ({ data, isDetailed }) => {
  const { title, description, publishDate } = data;
  const readingTime = calculateReadingTime(data.content);
  
  return (
    <article className="article-preview">
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {readingTime && <span>{readingTime} min read</span>}
    </article>
  );
};
```

**Bad:**
```javascript
function ArticlePreview(props) {
  var t = props.data.title;
  let d = props.data.description;
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{t}</h1>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### CSS/Tailwind

- Use **Tailwind classes** first
- Custom CSS only when necessary
- Use **semantic class names**: `.preview-modal` not `.pm`
- Follow **BEM naming**: `.preview-modal__header`
- Keep **specificity low** to avoid conflicts
- Use **CSS variables** for theme colors

### File Organization

- One component per file
- File name matches component name
- Group related files in folders
- Export from index.js for cleaner imports

```
components/
  previews/
    ArticlePreview.jsx
    VideoPreview.jsx
    index.js  // Export all preview components
```

### Code Comments

- **Why**, not what - Code should be self-explanatory
- JSDoc for functions:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Calculates estimated reading time based on word count
   * @param {string} content - The article content
   * @param {number} wpm - Words per minute (default: 200)
   * @returns {number} Reading time in minutes
   */
  const calculateReadingTime = (content, wpm = 200) => {
    // Implementation
  };
  ```
